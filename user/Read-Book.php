          <p>The boy slept beneath the stars, his flock gathered close around him. The night had been gentle, the wind calm, and the earth beneath him warm from the sun of the day before...</p>
          <p>He had come to enjoy these moments—the space between sleep and waking, when the world seemed to hold its breath. As the first bird called out across the hills, he knew it was time to rise.</p>
          <p>He gathered his belongings—his worn leather bag, a flask of water, and a sliver of bread—and began his walk down the hill. The world below shimmered in golden light. Everything felt fresh, like the first page of a story just beginning.</p>
          <p>The path wound through quiet forests, past streams and mossy stones. Each step reminded him that the journey mattered more than the destination. He stopped occasionally to breathe in the silence.</p>
          <p>By midmorning, the town's outline appeared in the distance. Chimneys smoked and market sounds echoed faintly. But still, he took his time—because some arrivals are too special to rush.</p>
